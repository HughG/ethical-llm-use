# Thinking & Research Approaches

## 1. Divergent Exploration
- **Horizontal Scanning:** Identifying diverse sources (academic, industry, grassroots).
- **Creative Synthesis:** Connecting disparate ideas (e.g., edge computing + ethical licensing).

## 2. Convergent Validation
- **Technical Feasibility:** Assessing power requirements and hardware constraints.
- **Ethical Auditing:** Verifying data provenance and licensing models.

## 3. Iterative Refinement
- **First-Principles Thinking:** Breaking down "Green AI" into energy, water, and hardware lifecycle.
- **Recursive Querying:** Using findings to deepen subsequent search parameters.

## 4. Systems Thinking
- **Lifecycle Analysis:** Evaluating the end-to-end impact of model training vs. inference.
- **Incentive Alignment:** Analyzing how "green" solutions affect performance and cost.

## 5. TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)
- **Contradiction Resolution:** Solving the "Performance vs. Energy" and "Utility vs. Ethics" trade-offs without compromise.
- **Ideal Final Result (IFR):** Defining a system that provides all benefits with zero environmental footprint or ethical debt.
- **Resource Analysis:** Leveraging "hidden" resources (e.g., idle local hardware, surplus renewable energy).
- **Inventive Principles:** Applying patterns like *Segmentation* (small specialized models) and *Extraction* (removing non-essential data).
- **Evolutionary Trends:** Mapping the shift from monolithic models to decentralized, efficient architectures.

## 6. Implementation Constraints (The "Pragmatic Developer" Lens)
- **IDE Integration:** Solutions must be usable within standard development environments (VSCode, JetBrains IntelliJ/PyCharm).
- **Simplicity & Speed:** Prioritize "Low-Code" or "Config-First" setups for the initial pass. Avoid spending weeks building a custom engine from scratch.
- **Architectural Extensibility:** Design for a "Plug-and-Play" future. The system should be flexible enough to swap in advanced techniques like Reuven Cohen's *rUv* agents or custom "Green Cloud" API wrappers.
- **Comparative Ideation:** Before deep implementation, formulate at least three distinct high-level architectural suggestions for user evaluation.
