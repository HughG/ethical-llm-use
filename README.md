# Ethical LLM Use

This is a text-based (non-academic) research project, rather than a software project.

I want to use LLMs (as a software developer, and for general life tasks) but I feel personally conflicted because of my understanding of (a) the ethical background of how many models were trained (pirated books, data, etc.); and (b) the environmental impact of running these models (e.g., large datacentres).  I realised I could try using LLMs to bootstrap me out of this conflict.

## LLM Context & Instructions
This section provides essential context for LLM agents to understand and interact with this project efficiently.

### Project Overview

I want to find ways to use LLMs with a better ethical basis in terms of training data and, more importantly, without causing significant environmental impact or damage.

My two main use cases are software development, and general "life admin" (e.g., booking holidays, finding services).

Your job as an LLM agent is to help me find resources, tools, and overall solutions.  You should act as a researcher who is highly skilled in technical understanding and creative synthesis.  There may be multiple approaches, combined in various ways; ultimately simplicity is desirable but evidence and effectiveness are more important.
